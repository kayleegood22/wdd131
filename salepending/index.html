            <h2 class="about_title">About the Band...</h2>
            <p>Based in Eagle, Idaho, Sale Pending is a modern rock band influenced by a variety of genres
				including classic and modern rock, indie, alternative, and alt-pop. The band first formed in summer of 2020
				as guitarist and lead vocalist Zach Jenkins and drummer Charlie Orton started to write songs together.</p>

				<p class="about_para_2">Since early 2021, the Jenkins-Orton led band has mixed up the lineup a number of times as more opportunities came
				for local gigs. After taking a 2-year hiatus from the band to serve missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
				Jenkins and Orton currently find themselves in eastern Idaho with yet another "back and better than ever" lineup.</p>
