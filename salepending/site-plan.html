			<p>About: Based in Eagle, Idaho, Sale Pending is a modern rock band influenced by a variety of genres
				including classic and modern rock, indie, alternative, and alt-pop. The band first formed in summer of 2020
				as guitarist and lead vocalist Zach Jenkins and drummer Charlie Orton started to write songs together.

				In mid-July, the band began the recording process for their first album with the help of professional bassist
				and sound engineer Jeff Abercrombie from Fuel. The self-titled debut album was released later on in February 2022.

				Since early 2021, the Jenkins-Orton led band has mixed up the lineup a number of times as more opportunities came
				for local gigs. After taking a 2-year hiatus from the band to serve missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
				Jenkins and Orton currently find themselves in eastern Idaho with yet another "back and better than ever" lineup.
